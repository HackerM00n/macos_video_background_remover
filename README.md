# Remove Background from Video - macOS Quick Action

## Overview

This script automates the process of background removal from a video using FFmpeg and macOS's built-in "Quick Actions > Remove Background" feature. It converts your video into a sequence of images, allows you to manually remove the background, and then compiles the images back into a video with an optional custom background color.

## Prerequisites

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (will be installed automatically if not present)
- FFmpeg and ImageMagick (will be installed automatically if not present)

## Installation

1. **Download the Workflow and Script**: Download the `.workflow` file and `remove_bg.sh` script.

2. **Install the Workflow**: Double-click the `.workflow` file to install it. This will add it to your Quick Actions list.

3. **Move the Script**: Move the `remove_bg.sh` script to your root user folder (`~/`).

4. **Make the Script Executable**: Open Terminal and run the following command to make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x ~/remove_bg.sh
    ```

    - **Manually Remove Backgrounds from a Sequence of Images**: The folder containing the image sequence will automatically open. Select all images and use "Quick Actions > Remove Background".
    - **Wait for PNG Files**: Please wait until the .png files appear before proceeding.
    - **Copy Audio**: After the video has been created, you will be asked whether you'd like to copy the audio from the original video to the new video.
    - **Delete Images**: Once the script completes its tasks, you'll have the option to delete the generated image sequence if you want.
